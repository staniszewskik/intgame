<text>At last, the time has come to assault the Sixth House.
  You are inside the western half of the Ghostgate, the tower of Dusk.

<text>After the final strike a sudden silence falls upon the chamber.
  Silence soon followed by the screams of Dagoth Ur as his power wanes and his body
  falls apart, together with Akulakhan, his creation. You escape from his lair to see
  that the sky is already clearing and a bright sun is shining on the ash-covered
  landscape. Prophecy fulfilled, Corprus stopped, Sixth House destroyed, your mission
  may not be over yet, but for now you can rest.</text>

<text>You are in the tower of Dusk. To the east is the tower of Dawn.
  Make sure to prepare well before venturing further north, for the ash storms
  around the Red Mountain hide many dangers, physical and magical alike.</text>

<text>Here's the list of commands that you can type to play the game:
  1. look around - describes the area you are currently in, as well as
  all the items, objects, characters and monsters you can see
  2. look at self - describes your health, equipped weapon and armor
  and lists the items you have in your inventory
  3. look at X - describes something that is in your inventory or in
  the area you are currently in
  4. look DIR - (where DIR is north, east, south, or west) describes
  what you can see in the specified direction
  5. go DIR - tries to move in the specified direction
  6. equip X - equips an item from your inventory if it is either
  a weapon or an armor
  7. pick up X - picks up an item that you can see around you
  8. interact with X - interacts with an item from your inventory,
  an object in the area around you, or talks to a character
  9. use X on Y - uses an item from your inventory on either another
  item from your inventory, or an object in the area around you
  10. attack X - attacks a monster in the area around you, but watch out,
  this locks you into combat until one of you dies (you cannot save
  or go in a direction during combat, looking actions are free,
  but attacking, picking up items, interactions or using an item on something
  allows the enemy to retaliate)
  11. questlog list - lists all the ongoing quests
  12. questlog X - describes the specified quest
  13. save X - saves your progress under the specified file name
  14. load X - loads your progress from the specified file
  15. exit - exits the game (make sure to save your progress before using this one)
  
  By the way, this book is quite sturdy. For lack of a better weapon,
  you can use it to bash an enemy over the head, so "equip manual" it,
  if you can't find anything better.</text>

<text>You inspect the body. The breton has multiple wounds inflicted

  to the east being here, but lost control over the conjured creature.
  You strip off his armor - it wasn't enough for him,
  but it should be of great help to you.</text>

<text>Good to see you here, Hortator. I know you are eager to stop the threat
  of Dagoth Ur and his Sixth House, but the Armiger I've sent to bring
  Wraithguard here still hasn't arrived. To not waste time you should take out
  the two minor Ash Vampires: Endus and Tureynul. Their Citadels watch over
  the paths that lead to where we suspect you will find Keening and Sunder,
  and it is advisable to have no enemies behind your back while you
  search for those crucial artifacts.
  Before all that, you should prepare yourself for the ash storms outside.
  Here is an ash yam and a portion of dreugh wax - mix up a potion
  that will fortify your strength using the alchemy station
  in the tower of Dawn. Speak to the healer that you will find there as well
  if you haven't already, I'm sure you will require her services
  many times before you complete your quest.</text>

  get much opportunity to use them lately. She notices you and says:
  "Muthsera, welcome. You'll be setting out to assault the Sixth House soon,
  won't you? Few come back from inside the Ghostfence in a state that
  allows me to help them. I've prepared a healing potion for you to use
  while you're out there, but you can also talk to me again if you need
  your wounds looked at".</text>
